<!-- Field 1: VISION -->

# VISION <img src="/assets/imgs/moonface.jpeg" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 20px; width: 800px;">

## More Affordable

### Space equipment demands stricter requirements than terrestrial equipment, including rigorous safety and reliability verification in addition to performance standards, resulting in significantly higher development costs. Space Cubics, a "JAXA venture," bridges expertise between consumer computer designers with proven success in space applications and JAXA engineers, who bring extensive design verification experience gained from space development projects. By combining these strengths, we deliver high-quality space computers at affordable prices, significantly reducing the overall cost of space equipment development.

## More Accessible

### Space exploration is challenging for companies and organizations with no prior experience, even if they possess excellent technology. Many interested parties are unsure where to begin, often causing projects to collapse during the planning phase. Space Cubics offers comprehensive support to make space exploration accessible, enabling companies and organizations to confidently embark on their journey into space.
 
## More People in Space

### Space Cubics lowers the barriers to space development by offering affordable space equipment and comprehensive support, fostering growth in the private space industry across Japan and Asia. The company was founded with the vision of encouraging widespread participation in space exploration by companies, organizations, and even individuals. This increased involvement will significantly expand the demand for space-related activities, paving the way for the creation and growth of new industries.

### *Our ultimate vision is a future where hotels are built on the moon, and space travel is accessible to everyone.*
