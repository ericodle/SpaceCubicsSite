# Making space exploration easier


## Our Vision

### In 2018, JAXA engineers and embedded CPU board designers teamed up to launch this JAXA-originated venture.
### A future where anyone can travel to the moon... To make this vision a reality, we strive to create affordable and high-performance space computers.

## Our Technology -- PRODUCT

### Even with costly radiation-resistant components, it’s impossible to prevent all failures in space systems, potentially leading to the abrupt end of vital missions.
### Space Cubics leverages technology honed aboard the International Space Station to deliver reliable products while significantly reducing development costs.
